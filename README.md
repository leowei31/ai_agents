# Objectives

The goal of this project is to build an AI agent that leverages memory, web browsing as a tool to give user insights on market data for a particular stock the user is interested in learning, essentially like an advisor for stocks. I am too lazy to research stocks myself and find it to be boring and tedious, so I am building this to simplify the process.

## Quantitative

* Compare results with baseline LLM performance, should see significant improvement
