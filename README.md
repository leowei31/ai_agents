# Objectives

The goal of this project is to build an AI agent that leverages memory, web browsing as a tool to give user insights on market data for a particular stock the user is interested in learning, essentially like an advisor for stocks. I am too lazy to research stocks myself and find it to be boring and tedious, so I am building this to simplify the process.

## Quantitative

* Minimize hallucination by checking with FactScore. Since we need the LLM to have claims that can be backed up with evidence, it is important to check how much the agent is hallucinating.
