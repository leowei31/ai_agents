Some notes here from deeplearning.ai.

Role playing, focus, tools, cooperations, guardrails, and memory. With AI software engineering, you can get fuzzy input with tabular data, mardown, text, math operations, you also do fuzzy transformation and fuzzy outputs. Agents can use tools and leverage data from external world. Multi agent system leverage agents to do different roles. Tools should be versatile, fault-tolerant, and have caching to save function calls. Multi agent collaboration, paralell execution, hiearchical, async execution.
